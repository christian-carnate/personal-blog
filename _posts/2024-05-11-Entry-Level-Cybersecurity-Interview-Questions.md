Congratulations! You have finally received a cybersecurity job interview opportunity. Knowing how to navigate an entry-level cybersecurity interview is a difficult task, especially if you do not have a great amount of interviewing experience. This article will hopefully assist you in progressing through each interview stage with flying colors and in obtaining your very first cybersecurity position.

## HR Questions

Regardless of the position you are interviewing for, you will have to answer HR questions, also known as personality questions. The goal of these questions is for the interviewer(s) to learn more about you, including your personality, work style, and thinking process.
- **Regardless of what happens, just be yourself, smile, and act interested in the position.**
- **Always remember to ask questions at the end of the interview.** The company is not only interviewing you, but you are also interviewing the company. Do not ask straightforward and direct questions (e.g., what is the hourly pay/salary for this position). However, learn about the work environment, the team, and the opportunities the company provides. Here is a [list of interview questions](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/smart-questions-to-ask-in-an-interview) that you can ask your interviewer(s).
- David Paykin's [interview guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yrsojorTDhMojsptToV4dOVdn05wFcvNT8iRtzpJpmQ/edit) assists you in building great responses to common HR questions.
- When answering situational questions (*e.g.,* tell me about a time you overcame a challenge), use the [STAR method.](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/how-to-use-the-star-interview-response-technique)

## Technical Questions

Technical questions test your technical knowledge about cybersecurity and/or IT, and the interviewer(s) may ask about your thinking process and what tools, policies, processes, and/or procedures you would use to solve a hypothetical situation. These types of questions usually come in a later interview stage after the recruiter and/or HR interview(s), but you must always be prepared to answer technical questions at any stage of the interviewing process. Here is a list of common technical questions for entry-level cybersecurity positions.
