Hello there! Thank you for visiting my personal blog. As far as a privacy policy goes, I am not collecting any of your information.

## Professional Summary

I am a senior and cybersecurity major at Grand Canyon University (GCU) in Phoenix, AZ, with an expected graduation date of April 2025. I currently work as a Security Operations Center Analyst for Grand Canyon Education (GCE), and I previously worked as an IT Help Desk Technician and Technical Support Representative for the same company. Outside of academics and work, I am the director of GCU's Technology Club Cyber Committee and a fellow of the Arizona Cyber Threat Response Alliance's (ACTRA) Threat Intelligence Support Unit.

I created this blog to record and document my learning efforts outside academics and work and to assist others in achieving their personal and career goals in IT and cybersecurity.
